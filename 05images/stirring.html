        <h1>Stirring the Pot</h1>
            <p>Today we have so many new machinery and tools that the bakers of the past could only imagine. Back then everything was done by hand with the simplest materials like a plane bowl and spoons. Nowadays we have so much more that basically does all of the "baking" for us. With all of the advancements in our technology we have had the amazing opportunity and advantages of having such fun, easy, and accessible materials in order to make the baked goods we desire.</p>
            <p>To add onto that, they had the struggle of starting from scratch, they were the ones to create all of these new combinations of ingredients to make things like cookies and cakes. I can pull out my phone and find a recipe in under a second, it just amazes me that in ancient times, women spent so much time to find combinations that worked for them when I don't know what I'd do without recipes in my daily life.</p>
