        <h1>Ancient Desserts</h1>
            <p>Believe it or not, Croatia seems to be the spot where baking began. This is where Archeologists found the
            first ever ovens in history, about <strong>6,500 years old</strong>. Croatia is also the first found location
            that used yeast in their bread! This was a very monumental moment for them, even to the point where once a year they would have a festival to celibrate the oven goddess.</p>
            <p>Somewhere between the 15th and 17th century spices and sugars started to enter the picture. The addition of all of these new flavors set the world wild. Baking went from simple breads and pastas to pies and gingerbreads to cookies and cakes! Once people realized all of these ingredients could be used for baking, it became way more accessable to everyone, allowing for more and more delicious creations as time went on.</p>
        
        <h2>Effects on the Future</h2>    
          <p>During the 18th and 19th century women began to get jobs as bakers and chefs, baking really was the beging of womens rights in the workplace! Through these women spending hours and hourse in the kitchen things began to get easier and better not only for the process but for the final result aswell. These women made a huge impact on the future and we still use many recipes and techniques as they used back then. So everytime you eat a nice warm dessert remember how much time and love went into that beautiful creation throughout centuries.</p>
